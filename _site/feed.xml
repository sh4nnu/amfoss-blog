        <title>Getting Started with Mozilla</title>
        <description>Getting started with Mozilla there are many areas where one can contribute to this organization.

    &lt;meta charset=&quot;UTF-8&quot;&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;Title&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;

Hello readers, I would like to share my experience while contributing to the Mozilla the Open Source organization. Mozilla is very broad organization and developers in the organization are very helpful. I am inspired by the commitment of the developers I can surely say Mozilla is one of the best places where all the people around us help to develop our skills and help when we were struck anywhere.

This blog post lets you know how my journey with Mozilla is started and also how a complete beginner can start their contribution to this organization.

&lt;!--more--&gt;

Getting started with Mozilla there are many areas where one can contribute to this organization. You can refer the link &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Developer_guide&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Developer-guide&lt;/a&gt; any time for building, contributing, submitting patches etc., This blog post mainly focusses on &lt;strong&gt;Firefox Desktop&lt;/strong&gt; for Linux (the Linux-distribution used here is &lt;em&gt;Ubuntu 16.04&lt;/em&gt;).
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Let's get started:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Make sure your system satisfies all the requirements before Building.
        &lt;ul&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;These Requirements for Unix/Linux.
                &lt;ul&gt;
                    &lt;li&gt;2G RAM with lots of available swap space. Additional RAM will significantly decrease build time.&lt;/li&gt;
                    &lt;li&gt;For debug builds: at least 8 GB free disk space&lt;/li&gt;
                    &lt;li&gt;For optimized builds: at least 1 GB free disk space (6 GB recommended)&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;/ul&gt;
            &lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;The following procedure is for 64 bit Linux Operating System. To check which bit processor you use, use the command &lt;code&gt;uname -m&lt;/code&gt; &lt;code&gt;&lt;/code&gt;in the terminal which gives &lt;code&gt;x86_64&lt;/code&gt; denoting 64-bit processor.&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;You will need python 2.6 or 2.7 installed, which you can check with &lt;code&gt;python --version.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;Finally, a reasonably fast internet connection and 30GB of free disk space.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
For more detailed list visit &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Developer_guide/Build_Instructions/Linux_Prerequisites&quot;&gt;build-requirements&lt;/a&gt;.

With everything set up let's jump into building firefox.

Create a directory named &quot;src&quot; under your home directory:
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;mkdir src &amp;&amp; cd src&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
Next download &lt;a href=&quot;https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/raw-file/default/python/mozboot/bin/bootstrap.py&quot;&gt;the bootstrap.py script&lt;/a&gt; and save it in the &quot;&lt;strong&gt;src/&lt;/strong&gt;&quot; directory.

Now you can start the bootstrapper using python 2.7 or 2.6 in the terminal
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;python bootstrap.py&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
Running this command leads you to some prompts and then follow them for building in the way you prefer if you are new to Mozilla and not sure what to choose? go with the default.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Community Access:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
For contributing to any organization you need to get access to the developer community, IRC, mailing list, Bug-Tracker.

&lt;a href=&quot;https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/&quot;&gt;Bugzilla&lt;/a&gt; is the Mozilla's issue tracker, you will need an account in this tracker to log into and comment or submit a patch for a bug. You can use GitHub account also for making an account.

Most of the discussion in the community takes place in the IRC. You can ask for guidance and help during the build or fixing an error/bug in the IRC. I prefer the IRC client &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.irccloud.com/&quot;&gt;IRCCLOUD&lt;/a&gt; for chatting in the IRC. Follow this &lt;a href=&quot;https://wiki.mozilla.org/IRC&quot;&gt;documentation&lt;/a&gt; to know how to use IRC. Some of the important channel names which may help you in the beginning are

&lt;em&gt;&lt;code&gt;#introduction, #build, #coding, #newbies, #qa &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt; these channels will help you by providing support and help.
&lt;h2&gt;Getting the source code:&lt;/h2&gt;
If you didn't allow the bootstrapper to download the Mozilla-unified you can clone it using Mercurial (a VCS which Mozilla community uses).
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;hg clone https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;**NOTE**:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; If your network is not fast enough or having any interruptions in the connection cloning will give some issues and source code will not be downloaded properly. For this try

(If cloning is completed without any errors you can skip this step).

&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mercurial Bundle:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

The advantage of building the source code using bundles is unlike the &lt;code&gt;hg clone&lt;/code&gt; you can pause and resume your download whenever there is an interruption to the connection. For this download the desired bundle of source code, you are interested in working and download it.

Up-to-date bundles of some repositories can be found in &lt;a href=&quot;https://hg.mozilla.org/&quot;&gt;https://hg.mozilla.org/&lt;/a&gt; which are available on a CDN (Content Delivery Network) at &lt;a href=&quot;https://hg.cdn.mozilla.net/&quot;&gt;https://hg.cdn.mozilla.net/&lt;/a&gt; you can download the Mozilla-central repository from here. Generally, &lt;strong&gt;zstd bundles&lt;/strong&gt; are preferred they are smaller in size and faster to decompress but they are supported on the modern version of mercurial clients only. To avoid confusion rename the downloaded file as &quot;&lt;strong&gt;bundle.hg&lt;/strong&gt;&quot;.

Follow the below steps:
&lt;pre class=&quot;line-numbers  language-html&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-html&quot;&gt;mkdir mozilla-central
hg init mozilla-central
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;line-numbers  language-html&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-html&quot;&gt;cd mozilla-central
hg unbundle /...../bundle.hg
 &lt;code&gt;hg config --edit&lt;/code&gt; or  &lt;code&gt; EDITOR=&lt;editor-of-your-choice&gt; hg config --edit&lt;/code&gt; &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;line-numbers  language-html&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-html&quot;&gt;[paths]Let
default = https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;line-numbers  language-html&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-html&quot;&gt;hg pull&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;line-numbers  language-html&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-html&quot;&gt;hg update&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
Here we initialized mercurial in the Mozilla-central directory. and configured .hgrc for default path, which will pull or push to the default link. Try to fix any errors if you encounter any in these steps. Once everything works properly, we successfully downloaded the source code for Firefox. The commands &quot;&lt;strong&gt;hg pull&quot; &lt;/strong&gt;and &quot;&lt;strong&gt;hg update&quot; &lt;/strong&gt;will help you to keep the source up-to-date.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Building the Source Code:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
Building a source code is similar to compiling your program before execution here it is more simple. But if you are building Mozilla-central for the first time it's better to grab a cup of coffee and a novel to read, because it takes a lot of time for building. You can anytime build your code using :
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;./mach build&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
If you encounter any errors related to LLVM/CLANG install the version asked for and again run &quot;&lt;strong&gt;./mach build&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;Let the  fun begin:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
With everything set you may now run your code and visualize the project when you run the code, using &lt;code&gt;./mach run&lt;/code&gt; which will launch the nightly version of Firefox. With this you are ready to hack into the firefox and explore, fix-issues, create new features ...etc., You can now start communicating to people via #introduction take up a &quot;&lt;strong&gt;good-first-bug&quot;&lt;/strong&gt; and start contributing.

Have a happy contribution...

See you all later with another blog post.

        <title>Powerful things you can do with the Markdown editor</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;There are lots of powerful things you can do with the Markdown editor. If you’ve gotten pretty comfortable with writing in Markdown, then you may enjoy some more advanced tips about the types of things you can do with Markdown!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As with the last post about the editor, you’ll want to be actually editing this post as you read it so that you can see all the Markdown code we’re using.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;special-formatting&quot;&gt;Special formatting&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As well as bold and italics, you can also use some other special formatting in Markdown when the need arises, for example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;del&gt;strike through&lt;/del&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;==highlight==&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;*escaped characters*&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;writing-code-blocks&quot;&gt;Writing code blocks&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two types of code elements which can be inserted in Markdown, the first is inline, and the other is block. Inline code is formatted by wrapping any word or words in back-ticks, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;like this&lt;/code&gt;. Larger snippets of code can be displayed across multiple lines using triple back ticks:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;.my-link {
    text-decoration: underline;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to get really fancy, you can even add syntax highlighting using Rouge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/8.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;walking&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;reference-lists&quot;&gt;Reference lists&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The quick brown jumped over the lazy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another way to insert links in markdown is using reference lists. You might want to use this style of linking to cite reference material in a Wikipedia-style. All of the links are listed at the end of the document, so you can maintain full separation between content and its source or reference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;full-html&quot;&gt;Full HTML&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the best part of Markdown is that you’re never limited to just Markdown. You can write HTML directly in the Markdown editor and it will just work as HTML usually does. No limits! Here’s a standard YouTube embed code as an example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe style=&quot;width:100%;&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/Cniqsc9QfDo?rel=0&amp;amp;showinfo=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The first mass-produced book to deviate from a rectilinear format</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The first mass-produced book to deviate from a rectilinear format, at least in the United States, is thought to be this 1863 edition of Red Riding Hood, cut into the shape of the protagonist herself with the troublesome wolf curled at her feet. Produced by the Boston-based publisher Louis Prang, this is the first in their “Doll Series”, a set of five “die-cut” books, known also as shape books — the other titles being Robinson Crusoe, Goody Two-Shoes (also written by Red Riding Hood author Lydia Very), Cinderella, and King Winter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An 1868 Prang catalogue would later claim that such “books in the shape of a regular paper Doll… originated with us”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It would seem the claim could also extend to die cut books in general, as we can’t find anything sooner, but do let us know in the comments if you have further light to shed on this! Such books are, of course, still popular in children’s publishing today, though the die cutting is not now limited to mere outlines, as evidenced in a beautiful 2014 version of the same Little Red Riding Hood story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The die cut has also been employed in the non-juvenile sphere as well, a recent example being Jonathan Safran Foer’s ambitious Tree of Codes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for this particular rendition of Charles Perrault’s classic tale, the text and design is by Lydia Very (1823-1901), sister of Transcendentalist poet Jones Very. The gruesome ending of the original - which sees Little Red Riding Hood being gobbled up as well as her grandmother - is avoided here, the gore giving way to the less bloody aims of the morality tale, and the lesson that one should not disobey one’s mother.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>About Bundler</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;gem install bundler&lt;/code&gt; installs the bundler gem through RubyGems. You only need to install it once - not every time you create a new Jekyll project. Here are some additional details:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;bundler&lt;/code&gt; is a gem that manages other Ruby gems. It makes sure your gems and gem versions are compatible, and that you have all necessary dependencies each gem requires.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Gemfile&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Gemfile.lock&lt;/code&gt; files inform &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Bundler&lt;/code&gt; about the gem requirements in your site. If your site doesn’t have these Gemfiles, you can omit &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;bundle exec&lt;/code&gt; and just &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;run jekyll serve&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you run &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;bundle exec jekyll serve&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Bundler&lt;/code&gt; uses the gems and versions as specified in &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Gemfile.lock&lt;/code&gt; to ensure your Jekyll site builds with no compatibility or dependency conflicts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For more information about how to use &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Bundler&lt;/code&gt; in your Jekyll project, this tutorial should provide answers to the most common questions and explain how to get up and running quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>We all wait for summer</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;As I engage in the so-called “bull sessions” around and about the school, I too often find that most college men have a misconception of the purpose of education. Most of the “brethren” think that education should equip them with the proper instruments of exploitation so that they can forever trample over the masses. Still others think that education should furnish them with noble ends rather than means to an end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems to me that education has a two-fold function to perform in the life of man and in society: the one is utility and the other is culture. Education must enable a man to become more efficient, to achieve with increasing facility the ligitimate goals of his life.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Tree of Codes</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The first mass-produced book to deviate from a rectilinear format, at least in the United States, is thought to be this 1863 edition of Red Riding Hood, cut into the shape of the protagonist herself with the troublesome wolf curled at her feet. Produced by the Boston-based publisher Louis Prang, this is the first in their “Doll Series”, a set of five “die-cut” books, known also as shape books — the other titles being Robinson Crusoe, Goody Two-Shoes (also written by Red Riding Hood author Lydia Very), Cinderella, and King Winter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for this particular rendition of Charles Perrault’s classic tale, the text and design is by Lydia Very (1823-1901), sister of Transcendentalist poet Jones Very. The gruesome ending of the original — which sees Little Red Riding Hood being gobbled up as well as her grandmother — is avoided here, the gore giving way to the less bloody aims of the morality tale, and the lesson that one should not disobey one’s mother.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It would seem the claim could also extend to die cut books in general, as we can’t find anything sooner, but do let us know in the comments if you have further light to shed on this! Such books are, of course, still popular in children’s publishing today, though the die cutting is not now limited to mere outlines, as evidenced in a beautiful 2014 version of the same Little Red Riding Hood story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An 1868 Prang catalogue would later claim that such “books in the shape of a regular paper Doll… originated with us”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The die cut has also been employed in the non-juvenile sphere as well, a recent example being Jonathan Safran Foer’s ambitious Tree of Codes.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Press and education</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Even the press, the classroom, the platform, and the pulpit in many instances do not give us objective and unbiased truths. To save man from the morass of propaganda, in my opinion, is one of the chief aims of education. Education must enable one to sift and weigh evidence, to discern the true from the false, the real from the unreal, and the facts from the fiction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Education must also train one for quick, &lt;strong&gt;resolute and effective thinking&lt;/strong&gt;. To think incisively and to think for one’s self is very difficult.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We are prone to let our mental life become invaded by legions of half truths, prejudices, and propaganda. At this point, I often wonder whether or not education is fulfilling its purpose. A great majority of the so-called educated people do not think logically and scientifically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The function of education, therefore, is to teach one to think intensively and to think critically. But education which stops with efficiency may prove the greatest menace to society. The most dangerous criminal may be the man gifted with reason, but with no morals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The late Eugene Talmadge, in my opinion, possessed one of the better minds of Georgia, or even America. Moreover, he wore the Phi Beta Kappa key. By all measuring rods, Mr. Talmadge could think critically and intensively; yet he contends that I am an inferior being. Are those the types of men we call educated?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We must remember that intelligence is not enough. Intelligence plus character–that is the goal of true education. The complete education gives one not only power of concentration, but worthy objectives upon which to concentrate. The broad education will, therefore, transmit to one not only the accumulated knowledge of the race but also the accumulated experience of social living.&lt;/p&gt;
