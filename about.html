Hello Amigo, If you are looking to know more about me?
<br>
Probably this is one of the best places you could do. Well coming to the introduction part, this is Manikishan here from a city named Vijayawada, of the state Andhra Pradesh, India in this vast world. I am Sophomore doing bachelors degree in Computer Science in Amrita Vishwavidyapeetham Ampritapuri, India. This is my first time living out of my state for education away from my family. I had my schooling in my hometown Vijayawada till my +2.
<br><br>
Then I went through many decisions in choosing a right college/university for my UG finally, I ended up at the University I study in now. I love this place and the people here so helpful. Then one more appreciating decision I took after joining here is "<em>Joining in <strong>FOSS </strong>Club"- A Student club run by students mentored by a marvelous man "Mr. Vipin P". </em>Might be this is such a place you can rarely find where every student here helps, learn, teach each other and grow together technically related to Computer Science Department as a whole irrespective of the background they are from and irrespective of seniors or juniors. It's more like a family and this is it.

After knowing the place I study, I enjoy, I live. You should know some important parts of my life. Let me start with my Hobbies
<ul>
    <li>Drawing, Colouring</li>
    <li>Playing Games</li>
    <li>Listening to Music</li>
    <li>Writing</li>
</ul>
Writing Blogs is a new hobby I got and I am very interested to develop my writing skills.
<br><br>
Coming to Drawing and Colouring, I love this hobby I started this since I was 8. Whenever  I feel alone and the whole world is calm and I am unable to be peaceful,  this hobby helps me to get out of it. I usually used to draw pictures than colouring them because I was bad at choosing the right colour for the right place. Slowly I started colouring the scans of my pen/pencil drawings using apps like "<strong>Autodesk Sketchbook" </strong>this one's my favourite.
<br><br>
These are some of my drawings you should have a look at:

Apart from that, I solve Rubiks cube a 3x3.

I love physics the most I mostly see the world with physics. It sounds funny but I motivate my self with physics putting me in some theory relevant to the situation and try to motivate myself.

That's a bit about me, If you want to know more you should hang out with me once :p.

Thanks for Reading.
